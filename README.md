# admin

Bookkeeping repo for adminsitrative information. Issues raised in the `admin` repo should be related
to planning team activity. To close an issue, document the final result of the planning that took place
in the issue thread, and submit a pull request adding this document to the appropriate location in the
repository. For example, for a work day planning issue thread, the pull request referenced should add a
finalized agenda document to the repo, under the `agenda` directory.
